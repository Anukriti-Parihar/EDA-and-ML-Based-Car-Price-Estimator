# EDA-and-ML-Based-Car-Price-Estimator (Run in Colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z8L0E4VyK82oRcAUN8Jm6PRKymSSYh0w#scrollTo=MPKaaGH1kvpI )
This project analyzes a car dataset with EDA and builds regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict car prices based on features like brand, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more.

## Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world car dataset.
- Performed EDA with visualizations (distribution plots, boxplots, heatmaps).
- Built and evaluated 3 ML models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor (R²=97%)
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Identified key factors affecting car prices using feature importance.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Results
Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models with an R² score of around 0.97, indicating strong predictive power.
